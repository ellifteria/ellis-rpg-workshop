Welcome to the **Cursed Bazaar**!
Here, you are all **merchants**, either **sellers** or **buyers**.
**Sellers** find themselves cursed to sell, sell, sell—their entire lives dedicated to amassing wealth by pawning their wares off to unaware customers—perhaps by exaggerating just a bit on the quality of their goods.
**Buyers** are those unfortunate customers, addicted to acquiring more and more goods; buying things is all that brings their life joy by this point.

You—my dear, sad friend—have found yourself unlucky enough to land you a spot here in the **Cursed Bazaar**.
For you, there is no choice but to buy and sell and buy and sell in an endless cycle.
This is the **Curse of Capitalism**.

## Player Roles

### Seller

Each **seller** has 3 items they sell.
Upon becoming a **seller**, they chose these from the themed list chosen for the game or may come up with their own items closely related to that theme.
One of the 3 items is **cursed**; the **seller** chooses which of their 3 items is the **cursed item**.
The **seller's** goal is to sell this **cursed** item.
Selling any **cursed item** to a **buyer** immediately frees the **seller**, transforming them into a **buyer** and turning the unfortunate **buyer** to whom they sold a **cursed item** into a **seller**.

If a **seller** remains a **seller** after 3 **interactions**—i.e., if the **seller** is unable to sell a **cursed item** to a **buyer** 3 times in a row—a second of the **seller’s** 3 items becomes a **cursed item**.
In other words, the **seller** has 2 **cursed items** and one regular item.
If a **seller** remains a **seller** after 3 more **interactions**—so after a total of 6 **interactions**—all 3 of the **seller's** items become **cursed items**.

### Buyer

Each **buyer** is addicted to purchasing goods and must travel from **seller** to **seller** buying as much as they can, trying to avoid obtaining a **cursed item** that will turn them into a **seller**.
If a **buyer** at any time purchases any **cursed item**, they immediately switch places with the **seller** who sold them said item, becoming a new **seller** and turning said **seller** into a **buyer**.
Upon becoming a **seller**, the former **buyer** chooses 3 items from the themed list or items of their choice related to the theme to sell and chooses one of the 3 to be their **cursed item**.

## Game Play

1. A theme is chosen from one of the themed lists, or of the players' choice.
2. All players are **merchants**, half are **sellers** and half are **buyers**.
To start the game, the **merchants** divide themselves evenly in half.
For games with more than approximately 30 players, this can be done with a 1d6 roll—all even rolls become **sellers** and all odd rolls become **buyers**.
3. **Sellers** choose their 3 items as described above and then disperse along the edges of the room to set up their stands.
4. Each **buyer** approaches and **interacts** with a **seller** who does not already have a **buyer** **interacting** with them.
5. The **seller** begins by describing each of their items—perhaps not entirely truthfully—with the hopes of convincing the **buyer** that they should buy an item off of them.
6. The **buyer** then chooses one of those items that they would like to buy.
They describe that item, what they intend to use it for, and what they are specifically looking for in such an item.
7. The **seller** then describes why their item is perfect for the **buyer** and why the **buyer** will be pleased with their purchase.
8. The **seller** and **buyer** then each roll 2d6.
    - If the **seller** rolls a higher total sum than the **buyer**, the **buyer** purchases the item.
    If the item the **buyer** purchased is a **cursed item**, the roles swap as described above.
    - If the **buyer** rolls a higher total sum than the **seller**, the **buyer** does not purchase the item.
    - If the **buyer** and **seller** tie, the highest individual d6 in the rolls wins.
    If it is still tied at this point, both the **buyer** and **seller** reroll 1d6 and the highest die wins.
    If it is still tied, the **buyer** purchases a **cursed item** off of the **seller** of the **seller's** choice, regardless of the original item being purchased.
9. The **seller** and the **buyer** roleplay the result of their **interaction**, describing why the item was bought or not bought and any consequences therefore.
10. Whoever is the **buyer** after the **interaction** goes off to find another **seller** to purchase goods off of and whoever is the **seller** after the **interaction** stays at the stand, waiting for another **buyer** to approach.
In other words, play returns to step (4).
11. This loop continues for approximately 15 minutes, or until all **merchants** want the game to end.
12. Once the game has ended, the **merchants** all describe the items they bought and sold to the other **merchants** around them.
