# Escape the Jungle

:::{.dropcap}

Welcome to the **the Jungle**!
You and your companions have found yourselves magically teleported to a mysterious, treacherous jungle and it is up to you to escape.
There is a path leading before you out of the jungle—but the journey will not be an easy one.
Along your path, you and your companions will be met with three **challenges**.
Beat them, and you will successfully **escape the jungle**!

:::

## Materials

**Escape the Jungle** is a game for 4-8 players.
Each player will need one six-sided dice (1d6).
The players will collectively need one copy of the **Difficulty Tables** and the **Explorer Creation Tables**—both are included later.

## Gameplay

**Escape the Jungle** is played by a **group** of 4–8 **explorers**.
Each **game** consists of 3 **rounds**, each of which consists of a single **challenge**.
Each **challenge** consists of 2 dice rolls

:::{.sidenote}

For longer or shorter games, the number of **rounds** per **game** and the number of **challenges** per **round** can both be changed at the players' discretion.

:::

In each **round**, **explorers** each roll 1d6 to determine what **challenge** they will face that **round**.
Then, one **explorer**—the **explorer** who rolled highest—decides on and narrates a **plan** how the **group** will attempt to succeed at the **challenge**.
All other **explorers** are able to describe how they will assist the **group** in executing the **plan** if they so choose.

Then, **explorers** all each roll another 1d6 to determine if they succeed.
If the **group** succeeds, the **explorer** who rolled highest narrates how the group successfully executed the **plan**; if the group fails, the **explorer** who rolled lowest narrates how the **plan** failed.
The **game** continues like this until 3 such **rounds** are played.

After 3 rounds, congratulations!
Your **group** of mighty **explorers** has managed to successfully **escape the jungle**!
Take caution, however, for the **jungle**'s magic may draw you back in at any time.

<!-- 
There is a path through a forest to find the missing treasure. There are many perilous traps and obstacles. At each hurdle the team has to collectively roll, and add up the result, find the % 12 score, and determine the obstacle from the 2nd table below.

Highest roll describes how the group goes against a challenge.

Roll again, if cumulative total is greater than Base Difficulty + Difficulty Modifier: success, otherwise, failure.

Success -> next highest roll describes how goes right.
Failure -> lowest roll describes how fails.

Ultimate goal is to win all levels that the GM makes (probably 6 ish scenarios) to make it to the treasure

Base difficulty for N number of players (cumulative dice roll):

Game play is broken into three rounds of two rolls.

The first roll is the challenge roll, it decides what challenge the group goes up against.
The explorer who rolled highest in the challenge roll describes how the group will go up against the challenge.

The second roll is the contest roll, it decides if the group beats the challenge.
If the explorers pass the challenge, the explorer who rolled highest in the contest roll describes how the group succeeded.
If the explorers fail to pass the challenge, the explorer who rolled lowest in the contest roll describes how the group failed. -->

## Detailed Gameplay

1. Each **explorer** determines their character **traits** using the **Explorer Creation Tables** (included below).
These **traits** guide **explorers** as they narrate the **group**'s **plan** and how they chose to support it.
2. Each **round** starts with the **explorers** rolling 1d6 each to determine what **challenge** they will face—this is the **round**'s **Challenge Roll**.
To determine the **challenge**, the **explorers** each roll 1d6 and the look up the total sum of the rolls mod 12 in the **Challenges Table** (included below).
If they have already faced this **challenge**, the **group** will face the next **challenge** on the **Challenges Table** that they have not yet faced.
3. The **explorer** who rolled highest on the **Challenge Roll** then decides and narrates how the **group** will beat this **challenge** based on their **traits**.
Each **explorer** can only decide and narrate a **plan** once per **game** while there are still **explorers** who have not had the chance to do so in the **game**.
If the **explorer** who rolled highest has already done so, the responsibility passes to the **explorer** with the next highest roll who has not narrated a **plan**.
If all **explorers** have all decided and narrated a **plan** the same number of times, then all may narrate a **plan** again.
If two or more **explorers** who are able to narrate the **plan** rolled highest, those **explorers** continue rolling 1d6 as tie-breakers until a single **explorer** rolls higher than the others.
4. Once a **plan** has been narrated, the other **explorers** have the opportunity to describe how they will use their **explorer**'s **traits** to support the **plan**.
5. Each **explorer** then rolls another 1d6 to determine if the **group** beats the **challenge**—this is the **Contest Roll**.
The total sum of the **group**'s rolls is compared to the **difficulty** of the **challenge**.
To calculate the **difficulty** of the **challenge**, use the included **Difficulty Tables**.
First, find the **group**'s **base difficulty** based on the number of **explorers** in the group on the **Base Difficulty Table**.
Next, find the **challenge**'s **difficulty modifier** from the **Challenges Table**.
The **difficulty** that the **group** has to beat is the sum of the **base difficulty** and the **difficulty modifier**.
If the sum of the **group**'s rolls is greater than the **difficulty**, the **group** succeeds!
Otherwise, the **group** fails.
6. If the **group** succeeded at the **challenge**, the **explorer** who rolled highest on the **Contest Roll** narrates how the **group**'s **plan** successfully got them past the **challenge**.
If the **group** failed at the **challenge**, the **explorer** who rolled lowest on the **Contest Roll** narrates how the **group**'s **plan** failed to get them past the **challenge**.
This completes one **challenge**.
7. This completes one **round**.
Go back to step 2. and the **game** continues until 3 **rounds** have been played.

## Difficulty Tables

### Base Difficulty Table

| Players | Base Difficulty |
|:---:|:---:|
| 4 | 12 |
| 5 | 16 |
| 6 | 21 |
| 7 | 26 |
| 8 | 30 |

### Challenges Table

| Roll % 12 | Challenge | Difficulty Modifier |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | An earthquake splits the ground in two | +3 |
| 1 | Two giant mosquitos swirl above | +2 |
| 2 | A horde of angry monkeys hollers in your way | +4 |
| 3 | A fellow traveler needs your aid! | 0 |
| 4 | A lion stalks you as you travel | +3 |
| 5 | The legendary hunter John Jose follows your every step | -3 |
| 6 | A massive stampede of wildebeests thunders behind you | +1 |
| 7 | A pack of Velociraptors are on your tail| +4 |
| 8 | A strange purple dinosaur stares menacingly before you | -2 |
| 9 | A hungry pterodactyl circles overhead | +2 |
| 10 | Carnivorous plants block your path | 0 |
| 11 | A terrible blizzard approaches | -1 |

To determine the **difficulty** of a **challenge**, first find the **group**'s **base difficulty** from the **Base Difficulty Table**.
Then, add the **difficulty modifier** for that **challenge** on the **Challenges Table** to calculate the **challenge**'s **difficulty**.

For example, suppose a **group** of 6 **explorers** is going up against **challenge** 4, the lion.
The **base difficulty** for the **group** is 21 and the **difficulty modifier** is +3.
Therefore, the **difficulty** of this **challenge** for this **group** is 24—the **group** needs to roll higher than 24 in total on their **Contest Roll** to beat this **challenge**.

## Explorer Creation Tables

:::{.two-column}

:::{.column-break-after}

To create your **explorer**, roll 2d6 on each of the **Backgrounds Table**, **Personalities Table**, and **Mannerisms Table** for the associated **traits**.
The first d6 result determines which of the outer 6 categories of **traits** and the second d6 result determines which **trait** within the category your **explorer** has.

For example, suppose you rolled a 4 and a 3 on the **Backgrounds Table**, a 1 and a 2 on the **Personalities Table**, and two 6's on the **Mannerisms Table**.
Your **explorer** would be a *brave* *professor* who speaks in *whispers*!
